# kar_app
Here is a simple quiz hybrid application developed using React Native.

The UI/UX are based on the website [www.ornikar.com](www.ornikar.com).
The quizzes questions were also scrapped, using Python and Selenium, from this website but the scrapping code is not foundable in this repository for evident reasons.

This web application includes a login system that allows storing the history of users series.

Now also includes Dark Mode.
